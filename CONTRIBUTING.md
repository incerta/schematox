# SchematoX types

In our project, we have many plain and generic types. These represent the most sophisticated part of the `schematoX` library. In the early stages of development, it became obvious that we needed to shorten some names, like `ConstructPrimitiveSchemaSubjectTypeValidated`, because they were too long and noisy. However, we still needed a clear understanding of what these types are doing.

So, the solution lies in adhering to naming conventions. The reason why our type identifiers were too long in the first place is because we want to test each layer of schema subject construction separately. Otherwise we will have tremendous tree of `T extends U` incomprehensible by any human.

## Base short schema. "BS\_" prefix, "\_Req" & "\_Opt" suffixes

`BS_` is shortened `BaseShort`. Base short short schema represented by string literal. The `_Req` identifier suffix signifies that schema subject type should be required and `_Opt` is optional.

Required subject base schema short types:

- `BS_String_Req` – result in `string` schema subject type
- `BS_Number_Req` – result in `number` schema subject type
- `BS_Boolean_Req` – result in `boolean` schema subject type

Optional subject base schema short types:

- `BS_String_Opt` – result in `string | undefined` schema subject type
- `BS_Number_Opt` – result in `number | undefined` schema subject type
- `BS_Boolean_Opt` – result in `boolean | undefined` schema subject type

Those types gathered in unions by the following type identifiers:

## Base detailed schema. "BD_Schema". "BD\_" prefix

`BD_` is shortened `BaseDetailedSchema`. Base detailed schema represented by js object that always has a required `type`, `of` (for unions) property and some [optional properties](#detailed-schemas-optional-properties). Complete list of the base detailed schema types:

- `BD_String` – result in `string` or `string | undefined` schema subject type. Has extra properties:
  - `minLength?: number` – schema subject `.length` should be >= specified value to pass validate/parse successfully
  - `maxLength?: number` – schema subject `.length` should be <= specified value to pass validate/parse successfully
- `BD_Number` – result in `number` or `number | undefined` schema subject type. Has extra properties:
  - `min?: number` – schema subject value should be >= specified value to pass validate/parse successfully
  - `max?: number` – schema subject value should be <= specified value to pass validate/parse successfully
- `BD_Boolean` – result in `boolean` or `boolean | undefined` schema subject type. Has extra properties:
- `BD_StringUnion` – result in union of the string literals schema subject type
- `BD_NumberUnion` – result in union of the number literals schema subject type

In future we might support `BD_Union`, but it is up to debate if we do really need it or current constraints will suits our goals better than library general flexibility.

All those types is gathered under one identifier as union `BD_Schema`

## Detailed schema optional properties

- `optional?: boolean` – affects schema validated/parsed subject type and parse/validate `schematoX` logic
- `default?: T` – default value that should be populated on `schematoX` parse and ignored on validate flows, exists for all base detailed schema types
- `description?: string` – description of the particular schema property which can be used to provide more detailed information for the user/developer on `schematoX` validation/parse error
- `brand?: [__key: string, __keyFor: string]` – schema brand definition resulting in brand subject type which will be intersection part of the schema subject type. Currently we support branding only for the base detailed schema, the necessity of branding for the compound schema types is currently up to debate.
- `minLength/maxLength/min/max` – is used as limiting characteristic for schema value

## Construct type generic. "Con\_" prefix

`Con_` is a shortened form of `Construct`, which means something generic that constructs one type from another type. We don't want to use `Extract` because it implies that we are extracting something that is already there. We also don't want to use `Infer`, as it has a specific meaning within the TypeScript language itself.

## Extension type generic. "ExtWith\_" prefix

The `ExtWith_${extentionName}<T, U>` used for extension of type `T` with some `U`. For example:

```typescript
export type ExtWith_BrandSchema_SubjT<T extends BD_Schema, U> = T extends {
  brand: infer V
}
  ? V extends BrandSchema
    ? Con_BrandSchema_SubjT<V> & U
    : never
  : U
```

Will extend base detailed schema type with another type intersection.

## Parse and validated schematoX flows. "SubjT_V" and "SubjT_P" suffixes

`SubjT_V` is shortened `SubjectTypeValidated`. `SubjT_P` is shortened `SujbectTypeParsed`. Used in conjunction with `Con_` prefix. Both suffixes representing schema subject type depending on the schema subject check method: parse or validate. We support two flows of type inference for two main reasons:

- Validate flow returns reference to original object without any mutations.
- Parse flow returns deep copy of parsed object, replaces `null` with `undefined` and `undefined` with schema `default` value.

Because `default` value can be specified on base detailed schema ground level (`BD_Schema`) all type constructors for all base detailed and compound schema subject type will be split accordingly.

# Type testing

For type testing we are using simple technique:

```typescript
export const check = <T>(x: T): T => x
export const unknownX: unknown = undefined

type Optional<T> = T | undefined

it('Optional<T>: check', () => {
  check<string | undefined>(unknownX as Optional<string>)
  // @ts-expect-error 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
  check<number | undefined>(unknownX as Optional<string>)
})
```

The main drawback of this method is that we need double each check with invalid pair. Otherwise if `Optional` will infer `never` for some reason there will not be an error:

```typescript
check<string>(unknownX as never)
```

This statement will not cause an error.
